I have been an IT professional for 10 years. During that time I have worked with many industries occupying multiple roles. I have worked with Cybersecurity events related to ransomware attacks.
I have worked on IT infrastructure projects for companies such as Advance Auto Parts, and the UVA banks in the Shenandoah Valley.
